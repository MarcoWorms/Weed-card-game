Weed! is an easy-to-learn strategy card game where you and the other players compete to grow the most pot plants.

As you build your garden, you also try to prevent other players from establishing healthy crops. You can plant Dandelions in someone else's garden, Steal plants and even Bust another player for possession. Five plant cards in your garden closes the round, but watch out for Potzilla who can destroy it all.

###RULES - How to Play

Objective:To grow the most plants in your garden.

Shuffle the cards, then deal each player five cards face down. The remainder of the cards should be stacked face down in the center of the table. Also, each player needs to have a space in front of him (or her) to build a garden. The garden can hold up to, and should never exceed, five cards.

The player to the left of the dealer takes thef irst turn, then play continues clockwise. When taking a turn, select a card from the deck and then either play or discard one card from your hand. If the deck runs out, continue playing without drawing cards. If you cannot play, then you must discard a card.

The round ends when a player has five plant cards in his garden (or all players run out of cards.) Add the number of pot plants in each garden to each player's score. Keep Playing rounds until at least one player reaches 50 points. The player with the highest score wins. If there is a tie, play another round. 

Plant cards hold one, two, three, four, or six pot plants on them (Weed1, Weed2, Weed3, Weed4 and Weed6). Play a plant card by setting it in your garden. If someone has planted a dandelion in your garden, you must first kill the dandelion with the weed killer before adding another plant card. End the round after any player fills his garden with five plant cards.

Dandelion: The Dandelion card can be placed in any garden of your choice. A dandelion in someone's garden blocks her from having five plant cards and closing out the round.

WeedKiller: Use Weed Killer to remove a dandelion from your garden. After playing this card, discard it and a Dandelion card from your garden. Weed Killer cards can also be used to remove a dandelion from another player's garden.

Note: Trading cards is not allowed, but a player can use her turn to kill someone else's dandelion.

Hippie: Place a Hippie card in the garden of your choice on the top of the lowest plant value. If the player has two equally low cards, select only one of the cards for the Hippie. The Hippie smokes the plants on this card, then is discarded along with the Plant card.

Steal: Play the Steal card by placing it next to the garden you wish to steal from. Steal the best weed from it.

Butsted: Bust one of the other players by placing this card next to his garden. Confiscate his highest plant card and discard it. Leave the busted card next to his garden so he can discard it instead of taking his next turn.

POTZILLA wipes out everything in its path. Play this card on someone's garden and take all of her plant cards and weeds, then discard them with POTZILLA.
